This edition is for my great-aunt.  It was authored by one of her friends
and she wished to read it before she is gone.  To compensate for her
deteriorated eyesight I typeset this book with an easy to read font
(DejaVu) and in large letters.  This posed unanticipated challenges with
optimal line and paragraph breaking.  Other than the font I laid out
everything exactly as in the original publication.  This wasn't trivial
either because of the smaller real estate on the paper.

Compile it with `pdflatex 00-book'.
